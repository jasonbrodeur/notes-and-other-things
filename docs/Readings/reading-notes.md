Section 4: 
- Indigenous methodologies are the intersection of Indigenous Peoples and the world of research occuring since time immemorial
- "Researchers who work with Indigenous communities should emphasize an open-ended and flexible program of research that can fluctuate in focus to make accommodations for emerging needs and requests from community partners."

Section 5:
- Building relationships as integral to Indgenous research
- How to address your own relationality as a researcher and the relationship(s) between the University and Indigenous communities? How will you buold relationships and trust between research partners?

Section 6: 
- Our own experiences, beliefs, behaviours, realities and worldviews inform the framework of our research; and therefore, as individuals, we cannot claim ultimate authority over all things in our research.

Section 7:  
Three sites of human understanding
- The body: The external, which can be observed in the physical. Creation of the body is the phase of gathering ideas: IDing and expressing unique research questions. Body is what we can see, touch, and articulate.
- The mind:
  - Puts the body into context (e.g. lived experience). While the body is observable, that which is brough by each party to the research relationship is subjective, and equally valued as lived knowledge. Reflection as key to this process, as well as self- and emotional regulation.
- The spirit:
  - That which connections the mind and the body. Personal (as opposed to religion, which is social).

Section 8: Two row research paradigm
