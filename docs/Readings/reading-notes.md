Section 4: 
- Indigenous methodologies are the intersection of Indigenous Peoples and the world of research occurring since time immemorial
- "Researchers who work with Indigenous communities should emphasize an open-ended and flexible program of research that can fluctuate in focus to make accommodations for emerging needs and requests from community partners."

Section 5:
- Building relationships as integral to Indgenous research
- How to address your own relationality as a researcher and the relationship(s) between the University and Indigenous communities? How will you build relationships and trust between research partners?

Section 6: 
- Our own experiences, beliefs, behaviours, realities and worldviews inform the framework of our research; and therefore, as individuals, we cannot claim ultimate authority over all things in our research.

Section 7:  
Three sites of human understanding
- The body: The external, which can be observed in the physical. Creation of the body is the phase of gathering ideas: IDing and expressing unique research questions. Body is what we can see, touch, and articulate.
- The mind:
  - Puts the body into context (e.g. lived experience). While the body is observable, that which is brought by each party to the research relationship is subjective, and equally valued as lived knowledge. Reflection as key to this process, as well as self- and emotional regulation.
- The spirit:
  - That which connections the mind and the body. Personal (as opposed to religion, which is social).

Section 8: Two row research paradigm
- Bestows the responsibility to the individual rather than the broader indigenous community engaged in research at McMaster.
- Individuals are accountable for themselves and their conduct.

Principle 1: Dialogical Research Relationships 
- Not just limited to humans, but the land, waters, animals, and other non-human beings

Principle 2: Place
- Dish with one spoon: Responsibility to co-exist with the land and each other. 
- Before engagement with a community, think about is this a Christian, traditional or mixed community? What is their definition of membership within their community? Where is their traditional land? What treaties govern their lands? Do these community members all live in one area or are they spread out (on reserve/off reserve)? 

Principle 3: Equity within distinctiveness
Including Indigenous Peoples as a homogeneous group erases the unique and sophisticated epistemology and assumes that every Indigenous person and/or community is privy to the same treaty rights. 
- E.g. Only First Nations can hold Indian status cards and are eligible for rights held under the Indian Act of 1876. 

Principle 4: Intentional pluralism and diversity
- Settlers' row has taken up more space than what was originally agreed upon (and symbolized as the blue rows in the wampum)
- ![[Pasted image 20240107230327.png]]
Principle 5: Sharing Knowledge; not owning it
- In Indigenous epistemology, knowledge is not made by humans, it is a gift that is given and a byproduct of good relations. 
- Not everyone or everything is deserving of knowledge

Sections 9 and 10: 
- Some intriguing sections about collaboration and decision making about what gets analyzed, disseminated, etc. 
- What happens in cases where not releasing certain findings biases all of the results? Is there concern of selection bias or cherry picking? 

Section 11: Shared conceptual ground
- Fundamental differences in how the University and Indigenous Peoples understand knowledge production. 
- Instead of focusing on this difference, advice is to focus on emphasizing an open-ended and flexible program of research that can fluctuate in focus to make accommodations for emerging needs and requests from community partners."

Section 13: Navigating institutional processes 
- Developing a research data management plan
	- DMP may include: 
		- First nations, inuit, and/or metis principles of data governance
		- Collective understanding of how knowledge generated from the project will be shared.
		- Clear understanding of where data will be stored, who will have access, and for how long. 
		- =Do we need to ask a revision to the advice to advise with MILO on DMPs?=
- REBs
	- The guidance provided is a bit inaccurate, as some non-FHS researchers may need to submit to HiREB.
