### Opening Plenary: Clifford Lynch
[Description](https://cnifall23mtg.sched.com/event/1VHgP/opening-plenary-clifford-lynch?iframe=no)
Location: Salons I & II

#### Off the top
- ==TO DO: Schedule a time to share CNI videos early in the new year.==
- A reminder to member institution reps to share information as appropriate within the institution. 
	- ==TO DO: Share these out more regularly. ==
- CNI reports -- items for further conversation 

### Infrastructure
- We are in the exascale computing age. 
	- New machines coming online - e.g. Frontier @ Oak Ridges
- Broader revisitation of what constitutes infrastructure. 
- Implications of attaching experimental equipment to broad networks
	- Carnegie Mellon University (see presentation in Dec 2021). Carnegie Mellon University’s [Cloud Lab Project](https://cloudlab.cmu.edu/) [video]([https://www.cni.org/mm/fall-2021/plenary-sessions-f21/#cloud-lab](https://www.cni.org/mm/fall-2021/plenary-sessions-f21/#cloud-lab)
	- e.g. Self-driving labs
- Cybersecurity
	- The stats are scary -- ransomware, disruption, variety of attacks 
	- Social, critical, and cultural infrastructure under attack
	- ==TO DO: Continue and prioritize our tabletopping exercises related to restoring infrastructure after an attack.==
- Digital Twins
	- Simulation model paired with a physical model -- use both interactively to inform the other 
	- [NIST article](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/02/how-digital-twins-could-protect-manufacturers-cyberattacks)
#### AI
- It's a confusing space and incredibly lack of transparency
- All sorts of chatbots built on LLMs; everyone is using them; very few really understand how they work and exactly what the can/should be used for
	- Lots of conjecture / discussion of regulation / demoware and fake demoware 
- CNI + ARL [task force](https://www.arl.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ARL-CNI-Task-Force-on-Scenario-Planning-Charge.pdf): Will share the first draft of scenarios and how they have shaped out. Hope to have a final draft by ARL meeting later in the spring. 
	- Will be helpful as a tool for institutional and community discussions. 
	- ==TO DO: Find the link==
- Key issues related to AI & ML
	- Trajectory: To a highly structure oligopoly or a patchwork of grassroots / specialized initiatives
		- Oligopoly argument: "These models are incredibly expensive to generate and run; we need big players in this space to support and monetize"
		- Counter argument: Many groups working on smaller and "smarter" models that can be more parsimonious and precise. 
	- Calls for policy and regulation 
		- Some aligning interests in the direction of oligopoly / centralization: Much easier to regulate a centralized industry; also, regulatory capture is possible when you have a few, large players. 
		- The more distributed this is, the harder it will be to regulate (e.g. the cryptography wars of the 1980s).
	- How important is generative AI vs broader portfolio of AI/ML? 
		- GAI talks to / resonates with a lot of people -- many people have to write/create things. It also threatens many who makes those things for a living 
		- National Academies' workshop in Generative AI and scientific discovery [Link](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ai-for-scientific-discovery-a-workshop)
		- Cliff's take: Generative AI will be much less important in supporting the process of discovery as it is for general public use.
	- Training data
		- Uncertain legal status of copyrighted training data
		- Liability, privacy, transparency and attribution questions. 
		- If training data is polluted by significant amounts of synthetic material (generated by GAI), then the value of the training data deteriorates rapidly
		- "Have we run out of content to feed these things?" 
		- "How stable are these models as they incorporate ongoing training via interaction?"
			- e.g. OpenAI chatbots have become worse at arithmetic as they've interacted with humans. 
		- Interactions between training model and model functionality
			- e.g., training on scholarly content (see the Allen Institute). Not a lot of results out yet. 
			- [Aurora GPT](https://wccftech.com/intel-aurora-genai-chatgpt-competitor-generative-ai-model-with-1-trillion-parameters/) - trained on scientific literature, data, code | 1 trillion parameter
	- What does it mean to be "open" in the AI space? And how do we preserve these systems?
		- Requires a nuanced set of definitions for "openness"
#### Scholarly Communications
- CNI executive roundtable for RDM -- report coming out soon
- Significant increase in desire for services. Due to:
	- Funding policies, NIH data sharing policies
	- Increasing understanding from researchers that they don't know how to do this and need guidance. 
- Not sure how to do this at scale? 
	- To what extent do we teach about methods and tools? To what extent do we get involved in the process? 
	- It appears that researchers really want people getting involved in the process
- Reconsideration of the role of institutional repositories in hosting data vs. external generalist or specialized repositories 
- Success in persuading funders and open scholarship advocates that code needs to be "first-class", alongside articles and data. 
	- Rapid adoption of AI tools makes this complicated -- how to share/publish these tools? 
- Success opening up access to the scholarly record
	- Consensus on funding OA is very fragmented 
		- A lot pushback against APCs and transformative agreements 
		- Calls for entirely funder-supported infrastructure 
	- A new debate is coming related to the economic and business models 
- A new type of database -- prediction database 
	- e.g. Google Deep mind (a couple of years ago) predicting protein folds 
	- Challenge: These are predicted results (and not discovered/synthesized and validated). 
		- Requires a whole new set of scientific methods and scholarly communications processes to support. 
#### Broader social/societal speculations
- The obvious: recalibrating how we assess truth in era of genAI -- we're here now.
	- The world is here. We aren't ready for it. An endless arms race between anomalies and tools to identify them. 
	- Efforts to formalize provenance through a series of digital signatures. 
		- e.g., cameras that sign the images they produce. 
		- Likely limited scope to this approach. 
		- It all comes back to trust -- do you trust the entity in charge of / operating the equipment? 
	- A role for information literacy: Teaching people about corroboration, provenance, source evaluation, etc. 
- US Copyright Office: Current position is that only humans can create; only counts if humans are using tools in a supervised way to create things 
	- Hard to know where the line is 
	- Need to rethink how we think about creators and their roles over the next 10 years. 
		- Will need to grapple with questions related to: "Who is a creator?", "What does it mean to create?" "How does ownership work in machine-generated content?"
	- Two groups/areas to think about: 
		- Creators are rightfully concerned/upset -- we underestimate in many cases how significantly this impacts their lives
		- Scholars -- How will scholars think about the use of scholarly works to train machines to synthesize and generate new information? 
	- Grappling with reanimation: If we can already make systems that can "create in the style of...", what are the implications for reanimated historical/cultural figures, family history? What does it mean when we can reanimate historical figures who can talk to you in a very convincing way about what they did and why? 
		- What does it mean when we package up our grandparents for future generations to interact with? 
#### Q & A
- Other cybersecurity incidents and throughlines: Toronto Public Library (did not negotiate; still not back up and using index cards) and University of Michigan (entire university)
	- A: Qs about how robust our systems are and the priorities around what to bring back. Public-facing (communications) vs technical back-end.
		- Another eg: 23 and me breach. 
- Quantum Computing 
	- Phase-in of post-quantum / quantum-resistant technology
	- Impressive progress on computation at quantum level. 
- How to consider genAI in terms of its climate impact? 
	- Challenge 1: Realistically quantifying the impact. 
		- Training + inferencing 
			- Inferencing -- e.g. search engines coupling search results to LLMs = significant increased computational cost  
	- Challenge 2: Reconciling the urge to "throw as much compute as it as we can for the time being" vs. investing in developing more parsimonious models. 
		- Not a lot of research on cost-benefits
### 1.2 To Increase or Decrease Capacity: The What, How, and Why of 21st Century Library Skill Development
[Description](https://cnifall23mtg.sched.com/event/1VHUb/12-to-increase-or-decrease-capacity-the-what-how-and-why-of-21st-century-library-skill-development?iframe=no)
Location: Salons D&E
#### Tony Zanders (Skilltype)
- The change that we see around genAI is not new -- the 21st century has been defined by constant change
		- e.g. Library websites (2004) - Outsourced Collections (2012) - Social Justice (2016) - COVID19 (2020) - genAI (2023)
		- It's not enough to think about how we deal with genAI, but to think about how we train ourselves to manage a changing technology environm
		- 
	 
 - [Skilltype](https://www.skilltype.com/): been working on this since late 2010s
- Libraries find themselves revisiting the way they quantify and communicate their work.
- Step 1: Needs assessment: What are the priority skills and competencies for our library? 
	- Recommendations: Don't leave staff to play a guessing game -- communicate clearly the expectations for themselves 
- Step 2: Employee profiling: What skills and interests do we have? 
	- Can inform both operational and strategic work; even around whom we sponsor to attend various skill-building and learning opportunities. 
- Step 2: Talent audit: Where are our skill gaps? (i.e., what we need vs what we have?)
### Keith Webster (CMU)
- With respect to genAI, we will find new and better ways to solve the problems that have typically been our jobs 
	- But we don't need to think about this as a substitution, but an opportunity to shift tasks of professional work. 
		- e.g. what are the routine, non-complex administrative tasks that can be given to technology to make more time for the more complex work? 
	- Not mass unemployment, but mass re-deployment
- [World Economic Forum, Future of Jobs Report 2023](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/)
- Intersection of talent + technology = digital dexterity 
	- See the [Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) Digital Dexterity Framework](https://www.caul.edu.au/digital-dexterity-framework)
- Currently accelerating our work to meet the growing and changing needs related to digital research and open scholarship. 
- @CarnegieMellon: Investment in people is critical 
	- Give each employee $2,500 PD fund to support conference/webinar/membership 
	- This year, set aside a separate fund for anyone who is seeking training in AI
	- Professional development coordinator -- shares training opportunities weekly 
	- Closed the Library for a day (during Fall break) for a morning of planning and experimentation + panel sessions on various topics of interest 
	- Use Skilltype
#### Karim Boughida (Stony Brook U)
- Common Theme: Disconnect between library administrators and staff
	- To skills according to staff: Data, digital scholarship, etc. 
	- #1 skill according to admins: "LibGuides"
- Library jobs amongst the top-20 jobs replaceable by genAI 
- What employers want: Skills, not credentials. Employers are doing skills-based hiring
- **PD always a priority -- never cut it from the budget** 

#### Q&A
- Developing skills in current staff vs. addressing gaps/limitation in current MLIS education
	- It's important to acknowledge that the principles of information management and arrangement are always going to be relevant, but very few indiividuals in the future will need to know how to catalogue a book, specifically. 
- What about "decreasing capacity" -- where might we decrease capacity? 
	- "decreasing capacity" is not about removing people -- it's about reprioritizing where they do their work.
	- In the very long term, the Library may end up with fewer people, but with greater specialized expertise (more expensive). 
- Libraries are no longer the primary provider of scholarly content -- gives us an opportunity to provide other important services 
	- Change from collections-based organization to a service-based organization. 
- Dept of Labour: Estimates 7% increase in information professionals by 2030. 

#### Thoughts
- A lot to think about in terms of our current state and trajectory with skills development within the Library.
- We need a fuller strategy for staff development

[Description](https://cnifall23mtg.sched.com/event/1VHVt/32-partnerships-in-research-and-data-services-high-performance-computing-collocation-and-facilitation?iframe=no)
Location: Salons D&E
#### Michael Navicky & Lauren Geiger (Mississippi State University)
- Using the [RCDCM](https://carcc.org/rcdcm/). Potential uses: 
	- user it as an in-depth SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) chart
	- Comparison with peer institutional capabilities 
	- Collaboration potentials within own institution. 
- Mississippi State University and RCDCM 
	- Using existing models and frameworks to build a team of people to support HPC services 
	- Running successful HPC is more than just the computers 
	- > Insert photo of slide
	- System-facing coverage 
	- When they got to the data-facing capabilities, realized that they just didn't know what was available. 
		- Reached out to the Library -- led to fruitful conversations. RCDCM proved to be an opportunity for collaboration. 
- MSU Research Team
	- HPC
		- strengths = Data storage, computational capability and knowledge, systems 
	- MSU Libraries 
		- strengths = RDM (description, visualization), service-oriented, well connected

	- Office of Research (compliance and funding) 
	- Researchers (needs drive services) 
- Challenges 
	- Departments are siloed; limited access to software, storage, compute; limited staff to train/support; recognizing the value of Research Computing and Data (RCD)
- Approach 
	- Build relationships around RCDCM 
	- Discover researcher needs 
	- Build systems and support staff capabilities 
	- Communicate with senior leaders, faculty and researchers about long-term value of RCD
#### Jason A. Clark & Doralyn Rossmann (Montana State Research Alliance)
- [MS Research Alliance](https://www.montana.edu/research-alliance/)
- ![[Pasted image 20231211164646.png]]
- They did the RCDCM as well. -- focused on researcher- and data-facing roles 
- People don't care who you are and where you come from: They just want to find people that can help them. 
- Researcher Alliance 
	- Floated 10 years previous as a Library hub
	- Secure funding and space allocation - housed in the Library
	- Worked with Rebecca Bryant from OCLC
- Partners
	- Office of Research Development 
	- Centre for Faculty Excellent (Provost)
	- Undergraduate Scholars Program 
	- Research Infrastructure 
	- MS Library (Their research data services unit is called ROADS--not confusing at all)
- Vision: Bring together expertise to help researchers meet goals 
	- Better proposals... (Need to get the rest)
- Co-location has led to "good collisions"
	- A lot more faculty coming into the Library
	- Promotes social interoperability 
	- "It's intentional work to connect" - being together in the same space provides the intentionality.
- What they did to make it work 
	- MOU -- especially around the in-person stuff (it's kind of like being roommates)
	- Move from virtual to in-person partnerships 
	- Defining services and communications 
	- Naming, signage
	- Communication channels: Email list, reservable spaces 
- Used the RCDCM to identify areas of weakness
	- Outcomes from the RCDCM helpful when speaking with University admins, because it is benchmarked against other institutions 
	- Doing the exercise helped them understand what the partnerships and activities should be. 
- Research Optimization, analytics, and data services (ROADS)
	- Open Ed theory and practice
	- Schol Comms and publishing
	- (see slides for rest)
- Activities 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231211165848.png]]
- Shared projects resulting from collaboration 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231211165823.png]]
#### Q&A: 
- What are the resources required to complete the RCDCM assessment and computing the results? 
	- Mississippi: "Finding the data" to complete the assessment was tough and took some time, but if you can get in contact with the right people, it's very doable. 
	- Challenge is getting the proper stakeholders to participate 
		- Understanding what people want and helping to meet those needs. 
	- Montana: Quite grass-roots; done as a means of brining better notice to the Provost / President
- How are peoples' FTEs distributed? 
- How is success defined? 
	- Montana State has metrics defined for success.
	- Cataloging outreach and engagement. Mine data about service partnerships. 
#### Notes to self / Takeaways  
- Q: Interested in the questions/pressures that you've had from upper university administrators about return on investment 
- How to integrate Research Offices folks more into the DRCP? How to make them active participants? 
- **RSD team: Role in supporting data science / AI?**
